Informative Image

Purpose
-------
The Informative Image annotation identifies images that convey meaningful content or information. Use it to tell developers which images need alternative text descriptions and what those descriptions should be. Clear alt text helps screen reader users understand the content and purpose of images they cannot see.

Designer notes
--------------
- Provide alt text that describes the content and function of the image (e.g., "Graph showing sales increase of 40%" not "Graph image").
- Keep descriptions concise but informative. Focus on what the user needs to know.
- If the image contains text, include that text in the alt description unless it's already visible elsewhere on the screen.
