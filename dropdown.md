Dropdown

Purpose
-------
The Dropdown annotation identifies a control that reveals a list of options when activated. Use it to tell developers what the dropdown label is, what options it contains, and which option is selected by default. Clear labeling helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the dropdown and navigate the available choices.

Designer notes
--------------
- Every dropdown needs a visible label that describes what the user is selecting (e.g., "Country", "Sort by").
- Specify the default selected option or placeholder text (e.g., "Select a country").
- If options are grouped or have a specific order, note this so developers can preserve the structure.
