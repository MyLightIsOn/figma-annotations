Chips

Purpose
-------
The Chips annotation identifies compact elements used for filters, tags, or selections. Use it to tell developers what label each chip needs, whether chips are interactive, and what their selection states are. Clear labeling helps screen reader users understand available options and their current selections.

Designer notes
--------------
- Each chip needs a clear label that describes its purpose (e.g., "Fiction", "Under $20", "Vegetarian").
- Specify which chips are selected by default, if any.
- If chips are dismissible, note this so developers can provide appropriate "Remove" actions to screen reader users.
