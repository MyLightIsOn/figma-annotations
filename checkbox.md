Checkbox

Purpose
-------
The Checkbox annotation identifies options that users can toggle on or off independently. Use it to tell developers which elements are checkboxes and what label each checkbox needs. Clear labeling helps screen reader users understand what they are agreeing to or selecting.

Designer notes
--------------
- Every checkbox needs a label that describes what the user is selecting or agreeing to (e.g., "Remember me", "I accept the terms").
- Specify which checkboxes are checked by default, if any.
- Checkboxes are for independent selections. For a single selection from a set, use radio buttons instead.
