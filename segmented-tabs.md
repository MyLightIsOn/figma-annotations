Segmented Tabs

Purpose
-------
The Segmented Tabs annotation identifies a control that switches between different views or content sections. Use it to tell developers what label each segment needs and which segment is selected by default. Clear labeling helps screen reader users understand the available options and navigate between content sections.

Designer notes
--------------
- Each segment needs a concise label that describes the content it reveals (e.g., "Day", "Week", "Month" or "List", "Map").
- Specify which segment is selected by default.
- If the tabs control a specific section or content area, note what the tabs are switching between so developers can communicate the relationship to users.
