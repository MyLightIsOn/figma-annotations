Button

Purpose
-------
The Button annotation identifies interactive elements that trigger actions (submit, cancel, open menu, toggle state). Use it to tell developers which elements should be buttons and what accessible name each button needs. Clear button labeling helps screen reader users understand what will happen when they activate the control.

Designer notes
--------------
- Every button needs an accessible name. For icon-only buttons, specify the label text (e.g., "Close", "Search", "Menu").
- Use action verbs that describe what happens (e.g., "Save changes" not "Okay", "Delete item" not "Remove").
- Distinguish buttons from links: buttons perform actions, links navigate to new pages or locations.
