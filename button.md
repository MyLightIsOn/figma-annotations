Button

Purpose
-------
The Button annotation identifies interactive elements that trigger actions or navigation within the app (submit, cancel, open screen, toggle state). Use it to tell developers which elements should be buttons and what accessible name each button needs. Clear button labeling helps screen reader users understand what will happen when they activate the control.

Designer notes
--------------
- Every button needs an accessible name. For icon-only buttons, specify the label text (e.g., "Close", "Search", "Menu").
- Use action verbs or clear labels that describe what happens (e.g., "Save changes" not "Okay", "View details" not "More").
- Buttons handle most interactions in mobile apps, including navigation between screens and triggering actions.
