Radio Button

Purpose
-------
The Radio Button annotation identifies a set of mutually exclusive options where users select exactly one choice. Use it to tell developers which elements form a radio group, what the group label is, and the label for each option. Proper grouping and labeling helps screen reader users understand the available choices and which are selected.

Designer notes
--------------
- Every radio group needs a group label (e.g., "Payment method", "Shipping speed") in addition to individual option labels.
- Specify which option is selected by default, if any.
- Radio buttons are for a single selection from a visible set. For multiple selections, use checkboxes instead.
