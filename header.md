Header

Purpose
-------
The Header annotation identifies text that functions as a heading (page title, section name, subsection label). Use it to tell developers which text is a heading and which semantic level it should map to (H1, H2, H3, etc.). Proper heading structure helps screen reader users navigate and helps all users scan content quickly.

Designer notes
--------------
- Match heading level to visual hierarchy when possible. (H1 = top-level page title, H2 = major sections, H3 = subsections).
- Don’t skip levels (e.g., H1 → H3). Maintain a clear, nested flow.
- Keep headings short and descriptive. They should summarize the content that follows.
