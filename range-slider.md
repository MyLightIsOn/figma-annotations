Range Slider

Purpose
-------
The Range Slider annotation identifies a control for selecting a value or range within set boundaries. Use it to tell developers what the slider controls, what the minimum and maximum values are, and what the current value is. Clear labeling and value information helps screen reader users adjust settings accurately.

Designer notes
--------------
- Provide a label that describes what the slider controls (e.g., "Volume", "Price range", "Font size").
- Specify the minimum and maximum values and the current/default value.
- For range sliders with two handles, indicate both the lower and upper values.
