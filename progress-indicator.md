Progress Indicator

Purpose
-------
The Progress Indicator annotation identifies visual elements that show task completion or loading status. Use it to tell developers what the indicator is tracking and what information should be announced to screen readers. Clear progress communication helps screen reader users understand that a process is ongoing and monitor its completion.

Designer notes
--------------
- Specify what the indicator is tracking (e.g., "Upload progress", "Loading content", "Step 2 of 5").
- For determinate indicators (with specific progress), note that percentage or step information should be announced to screen readers.
- For indeterminate indicators (spinning/loading), provide context about what's happening (e.g., "Loading your profile").
