Link

Purpose
-------
The Link annotation identifies text or elements that navigate users to another page, section, or external resource. Use it to tell developers which elements should be links and ensure the link text clearly describes the destination. Descriptive link text helps screen reader users understand where they will go without needing surrounding context.

Designer notes
--------------
- Link text should describe the destination, not the action (e.g., "Pricing page" not "Click here", "Terms of service" not "Learn more").
- If a link opens in a new tab or downloads a file, note this behavior so developers can convey it to users.
- Distinguish links from buttons: links navigate to new pages or locations, buttons perform actions.
