Link

Purpose
-------
The Link annotation identifies text or elements that navigate users to external content (websites, email, phone). Use it to tell developers which elements should open outside the app and ensure the link text clearly describes the destination. Descriptive link text helps screen reader users understand where they will go without needing surrounding context.

Designer notes
--------------
- Link text should describe the destination, not the action (e.g., "Privacy policy" not "Click here", "support@example.com" not "Contact us").
- If a link opens an external browser, email client, or phone dialer, note this behavior so developers can convey it to users.
- Links typically leave the app context. For in-app navigation, use buttons instead.
