# Figma Accessibility Annotations

A collection of accessibility annotation guides for designers using Figma to design native mobile applications. These annotations help designers communicate accessibility requirements to developers when handing off completed designs.

## What are these annotations?

Each annotation identifies a specific UI element type and explains:
- **Purpose**: What the annotation communicates to developers
- **Designer notes**: Practical guidance for using the annotation effectively

## Available annotations

- [Button](button.md) - Interactive elements that trigger actions or navigation
- [Checkbox](checkbox.md) - Independent toggle options
- [Chips](chips.md) - Compact elements for filters, tags, or selections
- [Decorative Image](decorative-image.md) - Purely visual images hidden from screen readers
- [Dropdown](dropdown.md) - Controls that reveal a list of options
- [Header](header.md) - Text that functions as a heading (H1-H6)
- [Informative Image](informative-image.md) - Images that convey meaningful content
- [Link](link.md) - Elements that navigate to external content
- [Pagination](pagination.md) - Controls that navigate between pages of content
- [Progress Indicator](progress-indicator.md) - Elements that show task completion or loading status
- [Radio Button](radio-button.md) - Mutually exclusive option sets
- [Range Slider](range-slider.md) - Controls for selecting a value or range
- [Segmented Tabs](segmented-tabs.md) - Controls that switch between views or content sections
- [Snackbar](snackbar.md) - Temporary messages that provide feedback or confirmation

## How to use

1. Review the completed design for elements that need accessibility annotations
2. Apply the appropriate annotation to each element
3. Include the required information (labels, states, relationships) as described in each guide
