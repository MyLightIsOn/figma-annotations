# Figma Accessibility Annotations

A collection of accessibility annotation guides for designers using Figma to design native mobile applications. These annotations help designers communicate accessibility requirements to developers when handing off completed designs.

## What are these annotations?

Each annotation identifies a specific UI element type and explains:
- **Purpose**: What the annotation communicates to developers
- **Designer notes**: Practical guidance for using the annotation effectively

## Available annotations

- [Button](button.md) - Interactive elements that trigger actions
- [Checkbox](checkbox.md) - Independent toggle options
- [Dropdown](dropdown.md) - Controls that reveal a list of options
- [Header](header.md) - Text that functions as a heading (H1-H6)
- [Link](link.md) - Elements that navigate to another page or location
- [Radio Button](radio-button.md) - Mutually exclusive option sets

## How to use

1. Review the completed design for elements that need accessibility annotations
2. Apply the appropriate annotation to each element
3. Include the required information (labels, states, relationships) as described in each guide
