Decorative Image

Purpose
-------
The Decorative Image annotation identifies images that are purely visual and don't convey meaningful information. Use it to tell developers which images should be hidden from screen readers. Hiding decorative images reduces clutter and helps screen reader users focus on important content.

Designer notes
--------------
- Mark images as decorative only if they serve a purely aesthetic purpose (e.g., background patterns, visual flourishes, spacing elements).
- If an image helps users understand content or context, it's informative, not decorative.
- Icons that accompany labeled buttons or text are often decorative since the label already conveys the meaning.
