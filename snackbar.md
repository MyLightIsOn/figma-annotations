Snackbar

Purpose
-------
The Snackbar annotation identifies temporary messages that appear briefly to provide feedback or confirmation. Use it to tell developers what message should be announced to screen readers and whether the snackbar includes an action button. Proper announcements help screen reader users receive timely feedback even when they can't see the visual message.

Designer notes
--------------
- Specify the message text that should be announced (e.g., "Item added to cart", "Changes saved").
- If the snackbar includes an action button (e.g., "Undo"), note both the message and the button label.
- Snackbars are typically brief and dismissible. Note if timing or dismissal behavior is critical for users to understand.
