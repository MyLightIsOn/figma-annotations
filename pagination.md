Pagination

Purpose
-------
The Pagination annotation identifies controls that navigate between pages of content. Use it to tell developers what labels the navigation controls need and what page information should be communicated. Clear labeling helps screen reader users understand their location and navigate through paginated content.

Designer notes
--------------
- Navigation controls need clear labels (e.g., "Next page", "Previous page", "Go to page 3").
- Indicate the current page and total number of pages so developers can communicate "Page 2 of 10" to screen readers.
- If page numbers are interactive, ensure each has a descriptive label, not just a number.
